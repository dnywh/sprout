# Sprout

An opinionated [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) template for budding new ideas.

## Demo

> Check out a live preview of Sprout, [here](https://11ty-sprout.netlify.app/).

## Features

### Included

- Date formatting filter
- Data file example
- Collection examples

### Omitted

Sprout is a balance between utility and quick-start. That means I've only added things that are _always_ needed on new Eleventy sites I make. Hence the short list above.

That leaves a bunch of features out that I _often_ use but would make for a bloated template. Some of those omitted features include:

- LightningCSS and/or Sass
- Video embeds
- Image handling
- Tags
- RSS

Instead, I've created an [ideas data file](https://github.com/dnywh/sprout/blob/main/src/_data/ideas.json) that links out to guides on how to add these additional features.
